                            Craig Coverman (“CC”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
                        
                        </p><br />
                 <p>This policy (together with CC’s terms of use and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the

basis on which any personal data CC collects from you, or that you provide to CC, will be processed

by CC. Please read the following carefully to understand CC’s views and practices regarding your

For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”), the data controller is CC whose

registered email address is <a href="">coverman1965@gmail.com</a>.</p><br />
                   
                      

                        <h5>INFORMATION CC MAY COLLECT FROM YOU</h5>
                        
                        <p>
                            CC may collect and process the following data about you:
                        </p> <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Information that you provide by filling in forms on the site <a href="">www.collegedaze.co.uk</a> (the

“site”). This includes, without limitation, your email address provided at the time of

example, if CC runs any competitions, when you enter such competition), and when you

report a problem with the site.</li>
                            <li>2. If you contact CC, he may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
                          
                            <li>3. Details of your visits to our site [including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data,

                        </ul>


                        <h5>COOKIES</h5>
                        <p>
                            While on the site, certain information is automatically logged about how you are using the site to

                            analyse performance and usage of the site. This information may include the URL of the website

                            which linked you to the site, your IP address and the pages you visit while on the site. The IP address

                            indicates the location of your computer on the internet.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            Like many online services, CC may use a feature called a cookie, which is a small data file that is sent

                            to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer or device’s hard drive. CC uses

                            cookies to enable you to enjoy the social media features on the site. CC also uses ‘analytics cookies’

                            (such as Google Analytics cookies) and other automatically tracked information to keep track of its

                            users’ browsing activity whilst on the site. This helps CC to understand how its users use the site so

                            that it can improve it. The information that CC collects through such analytics cookies is aggregated

                            and anonymous, so it does not identify you as an individual user.
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            By agreeing to CC’s Terms & Conditions, you are providing your consent for CC to use cookies in

                            these ways but you can delete any of these cookies at any time if you wish. Please note, if you delete

                            certain cookies, this may limit your use of the social media features on the site (but this does not

                            apply to analytics cookies).
                        </p><br />
                        <p>
                            You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. You can set your internet browser so that it

                            will not allow cookies to be stored on your device. This may reduce the functionality of the site and

                            may mean that certain features or content on the site will not be available to you. Further

                            information on how to prevent cookies from being stored on your device can be found at

                            <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">  http://www.allaboutcookies.org </a> under the 'manage cookies' section. Alternatively, you can access

                            further information by going to the help menu within your internet browser.
